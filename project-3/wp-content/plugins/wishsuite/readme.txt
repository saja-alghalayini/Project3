The Wishlist is an indispensable part of e-commerce sites nowadays that enables the customers to create customized collections of items that they desire to purchase and save those items in their user account for further use in the future. 

Adding an excellent Wishlist is essential and vital since it plays a significant role in improving the overall user experience. It benefits both you and your customers in multiple ways as in reality, it is used as a middle ground between purchasing and forgetting items.
